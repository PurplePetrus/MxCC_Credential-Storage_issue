This format can easily be reversed and passwords become visible in cleartext.

It concerns following passwords:

- Camera passwords
- MxCC Users passwords
- network share passwords

Tested in Version 2.5.4.5

* end of example *


As we can see in the @ByteArray we can find a base64 data string.
if we run this string in a base64 decoder we can recreate the passwords in plain text.
This for all passwords in the file.

This file is often backed up on a different location in order to recover a config when lost.
This file is also present on the workstation in order to load the config.

If this file is taken or accessed by an unauthorized person/process, this person or process can retrieve the passwords for
- all users in MxCC
- all camera login credentials
- credentials for access to share location if used for remote storage.

This could allow for practically any user with access to this workstation and access to the MxCC app to retrieve all used credentials.
Which can result in.
-	Unauthorized access to Camera devices
-	Privilige escalation in the context of the application MxCC
-	Unauthorized access to recordings
-	Unauthorized acces to networkshares
